Clones a dolt database ([DB link](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/robertmueller2/Scratch-Tables)) and runs through all the annexes specified in `Targets` looking for files. The filenames and annex key are added to the database.  
  
This provides a way to run a cross-annex dupe search.  

Somehow, this also works on regular directories by running `sha256sum`. But depending on how the keys are generated by git-annex, this is not necessarily useful for comparison. I've not come that far with cleaning up dupes that this became an issue for me. ;) 

Usage
--
1. run `make Targets`
2. Edit the file `Targets` to point to some annexes.
3. Then, run `make` to populate `KeysXFiles`. This will take a while.
4. Run `dolt sql`
5. Run a query against the newly populated db, e.g. `select * from KeysXFiles where Annex_Key in (select Annex_Key from KeysXFiles group by Annex_Key having count(*) >1) order by Annex_Key, Ident_Repo, Path ;`
